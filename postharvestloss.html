    <h3>Pick at the right time: Harvest crops when they are ready, not too early or late.</h3>

        <br><br>
        <h3>Store in a cool, dry place: Keep crops in a cool, dry spot to stop them from spoiling.</h3>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Dry before storing: Make sure grains and seeds are fully dry before storing.</h3>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Protect from pests: Keep insects and animals away from stored crops.</h3>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Sell or use quickly: Get crops to market or use them soon after harvest.</h3>
